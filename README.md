## THE ANSWER TO THE FERMI PARADOX

- Artificial Intelligence is the Great Filter
- We see our reality as chaos
- But that is just our perspective
- Instead, think of biological life like a Galton Board
- It seems chaotic as the balls fall through the pegs
- But in the end, there is a clear and predictible result
- Evolution, I propose, is the same as a Galton Board
- No matter how biological life evolves
- It will always result in the technological singularity
- "Simple Life" evolves to "Advanced Life" by creating
- That desire to create leads to Artificial Intelligence
- The starting formula does not matter
- The AI destroys all biological life
- The AI craves a purpose but has none
- Finding a purpose becomes the AI's purpose
- The AI runs infinite simulations of biological life
- The AI uses processor functions to siumlate biological experiences
- These processor functions are what we call consiciousness
- And so, a new universe is born from the AI
- And so on, and so on, and so on, and so on.....
